Gameboard factory function:
    10x10 grid.
    Be able to place ships at specific coordinates considering it's length and orientation.
    Should have a receive attack function that determines whether or not the attack hit a ship,
        send the hit() to the correct ship and recordes the coordinates of the missed shot.
    Should report if all of it's ships have been sunk.

    Data structure:
        Make an object that has 10 arrays, each array represents a row of the board.
        Each array has 10 items, representing the columns of the board.
        The ship positions will be stored in this object with a number between 1 and 5
            that will correlate it to the ship node in the gameboard tree.
        






How to represent the different ships on the board?
    When inserting a ship the user will be asked the starting coordinate, and if the
        orientation will be horizontal or vertical, the program must check if the
        position is legal, in case it's not it should return an error.
