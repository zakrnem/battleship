PC and user boards don't have the same number of attacks.
    When trying to report the number of attacks the code is failing
        because we are trying to count 'X' on the board, but attacked ships
        don't represent 'X' on the board, the ship number stays unchanged.
When the user presses a previously attacked cell the app throws an error that is not caught.
    
Enable random ship placement.
