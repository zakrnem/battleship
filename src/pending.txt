Gameboard factory function:
    10x10 grid.
    Be able to place ships at specific coordinates considering it's length and orientation.
    Should have a receive attack function that determines whether or not the attack hit a ship,
        send the hit() to the correct ship and recordes the coordinates of the missed shot.
    Should report if all of it's ships have been sunk.

    Data structure:
        Make an object that has 10 arrays, each array represents a row of the board.
        Each array has 10 items, representing the columns of the board.
        The ship positions will be stored in this object with a number between 1 and 5
            that will correlate it to the ship node in the gameboard tree.
        The receiveAttack() will check if the attackCoordinates cell isnt equal to a empty string.
            A empty string will represent a cell that hasn't been attacked and doesn't have a ship there.
            In the case that if statement is true, it will compare the number to a switch case.
            If the cell has a "1" for example, it means that the "Ship #1" has been attacked.
            So it should call the this.ship1.hit() to increase the hit's number.
            When executing this function the object will check if the ship is sunk.






How to represent the different ships on the board?
    When inserting a ship the user will be asked the starting coordinate, and if the
        orientation will be horizontal or vertical, the program must check if the
        position is legal, in case it's not it should return an error.
        
How to determine if a ship has been sunk?
    What are the common ship sizes?
        1. Carrier:         5
        2. Battleship:      4
        3. Destroyer:       3
        4. Submarine:       3
        5. Patrol boat:     2
