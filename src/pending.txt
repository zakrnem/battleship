1. Play against computer:
    Create board for player.
    Create board for PC.
        Assign ship positions randomly.
        PC will make random moves.
    Create main game loop and module for DOM interaction.


BUILD A RANDOM BOARD
    For the start coordinates:
        We'll create two random numbers, each of them between 1 and 10.
        The first number will be assigned to a letter.
        The second will be the number part of the coordinate.
    For the orientation:
        We'll create a random number between 0 and 1.
        0 will represent horizontal.
        1 will represent vertical.
    We'll need a iterative f() for inserting the 5 ships:
        After creating the random start coordinates and orientation we'll have to check
            if the ship[i] was inserted successfully.
            A ship won't be inserted in two cases:
                If part of the ship ends up outside the board.
                If a ship overlaps another one.
        Once a ship has been successfully inserted the app will proceed to insert the following
            ships until the 5 of them are on the board.

BUILD USER BOARD
    The user will input the start coordinate.
    Then the orientation.
    In order for every ship until the 5 of them are on the board.
